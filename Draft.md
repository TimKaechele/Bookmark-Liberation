# General Assumptions
one Installation = one user (no multi user support -> maybe later)

## Content Folder Structure:

```yaml
bookmarks:
  unique_token_folder: #UUIDv4 or UUIDv6
    - (bookmark_type).txt # e.g. (bookmark_image.txt|bookmark_video.txt|â€¦) 
    - image.jpg           # optional 
```


# Features

```yaml
- RSS Feed:
  - where(public: true)
  - possible to subscribe to other users 

- API
  - authentication only (maybe Oauth, maybe simple HTTP-Basic Auth)
  - RESTful JSON
```
