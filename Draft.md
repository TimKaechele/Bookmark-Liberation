# Draft

## General Assumptions

one Installation = one user (no multi user support -> maybe later)

## Content Folder Structure

```yaml
bookmarks:
  unique_token_folder: #UUIDv4 or UUIDv6
    - (bookmark_type).txt # e.g. (bookmark_image.txt|bookmark_video.txt|â€¦) 
    - image.jpg           # optional 
```



## Features

```yaml
- RSS Feed:
  - where(public: true)
  - possible to subscribe to other users 

- API
  - authentication only (maybe Oauth, maybe simple HTTP-Basic Auth)
  - RESTful JSON
  
- Import Utilities
  - Bookmarklet or other methods to import content quickly
  
- Flexible Catalog
  - group content by tag
  - full catalog search
```

## CSS
- Inuit.css
- BEM 

## Design 

- clean and unobtrusive
- speed and efficiency as goals

## Plugin System

### Spiders
- parse content properly
- pass page content to internal bookmark creation (image, title, description) 
- define template for bookmark (image, video, plain_link, custom)

## Standard Templates:
  - Images
  - Video
  - Plain Link
