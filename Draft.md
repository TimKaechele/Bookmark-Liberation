# Draft

## General Ideas
KirbyZoo should be a bookmarking service that is suitable for the average casual user as much as for the power user who just wants a fast and open alternative to existing services.
The whole system should be as open as possible. 

## Pricing
The whole system will be free (as in price) open source software, but to support further development we may include a Gittip.


## Features

```yaml
- RSS Feed:
  - where(public: true)
  - possible to subscribe to other users (maybe better solveable via JSON)

- API
  - authentication only (maybe Oauth, maybe simple HTTP-Basic Auth)
  - RESTful JSON

- Import Utilities
  - Bookmarklet or other methods to import content quickly

- Flexible Catalog
  - group content by tag
  - full catalog search
```

## CSS
- Inuit.css
- BEM

## Design 

- clean and unobtrusive
- snappy user experience on mobile devices (no imitation of iOS or Android)

## Frontend

- SPA Approach (Ember.js)
- Responsive

## Backend
- Kirby Toolkit
- Sqlite/MySQL
- speed and efficiency as goals

## Exporters

Your data belongs to you and by following this approach we will support a variety of exporters. You should not be locked inside one system.

### Possible Exporters
- Bookmark List
- JSON 
- Complete Datastructure (includes images) in an human readable form like YAML

## Plugin System

### Spiders
- parse content properly
- pass page content to internal bookmark creation (image, title, description)
- define template for bookmark (image, video, plain_link, custom)

## Types/Templates
Every Bookmark can has its own type. The type of the bookmark dictates its presentation. By doing so the KirbyZoo is useable by power users that don't want a visual bookmarking service, but an open source alternative to share and archive links easily. 

- Image
- Video
- Link

## Custom Importers
Similar to GimmeBar it will be possible to backup social media streams like Instagram or Twitter. These custom importers are not part of the core experience of the KirbyZoo but are addable as a plugin.

## API Endpoints

- [GET/POST/PUT/DELETE] /bookmarks/(:uuid)?search_query=(â€¦)
- [GET/PUT] /user/(:uuid)
- [GET] /tags/(:uuid)
